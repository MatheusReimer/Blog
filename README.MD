<h2>Context</h2>
</br>
<p>When I start to program in a language or when I'm learning a new design pattern I usually have no problems with understanding.
</br>
However, as soon as some time passes and I don't use my acquired knowledge, I end up forgetting it.</p>
</br>
<p>
Then, when I try to review what I learned, I no longer remember the context and I don't know where to start.
</br>
In short, I end up having to redo the same thing I had done before and this time I no longer have the same desire to learn that I had the first time.
</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p> The general goal of this project is to write down in the moment that im learning what are my doupts and once I understand it, write also the answer to it.
</br>
<p>The main objective of the project is to make the process of understanding easier. How will this be done? The process will be as follows: every time I'm learning something, a language or a design pattern or even a database, I'll also be documented during the process what my doubts are and once I find the answers to them, I'll document them too.</p>
</br>
<p>With that, the next time I need the necessary information, I will have access to the 'mind map' I had while I was in the process. And once it's online, other people could benefit from it too.</p>
